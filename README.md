REST Assured workshop
==================
For those of you looking to gain some experience working with [REST Assured](http://rest-assured.io/), here are all the materials from a workshop I've created and delivered multiple times to good reviews. Feel free to use, share and adapt these materials as you see fit.

What do I need?
---
A Java 8 JDK and Maven. That's it.

What API is used for the exercises?
---
All API calls that are used in the examples and exercises have been mocked using [WireMock](http://wiremock.org/). The standalone version of WireMock is included in this project, so there's no need for additional setup.

Running the mock server
---
In order to get a response from the WireMock mock server, you'll need to start it before you run your tests. You can do so by running this command from the `src/test/resources` folder:
```
java -jar wiremock-standalone-2.15.0.jar --port 9876
```
In the (unlikely) event that you've already got a process running on port 9876, you can run the mock server on any available port. Please make sure to change the references to the port in the `@BeforeClass` methods as well, or your tests will likely never pass...
